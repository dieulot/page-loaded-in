# Page Loaded In

This little JavaScript package will tell you how fast is your site by adding text to the desired place on your site.

## Installation

The usuall installation:

```bash
npm install page-loaded-in
```

```bash
yarn add page-loaded-in
```

Or using CDN:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/page-loaded-in@0.0.1/dist/index.js"></script>
```

## Usage (only required if package is installed from npm)

Just include the package in your JavaScript file.

```js
require('page-loaded-in')
```

That's it! If you have an HTML element with class `js-page-loaded-in`, you should see how fast is your page.

## Example

I've placed the “Page loaded in” text on my site in the footer section.
